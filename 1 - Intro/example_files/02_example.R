# Lines that start with a # are seen as comments rather than
# as code to run  

# You can run a single line of code 
# with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Enter` 
# or by selecting "Run Selected Line(s)" from the "Run" button 
# in the upper right side of this pane. 

# You can run the entire script with the "Source" button
# in the upper right side of this pane.  

# Lines that have four dashes at the end 
# make a "Header" that you can see in the document outlines
# stacked lines button, top right of pane; and
# at the bottom left of the pane
