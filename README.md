Welcome! The two R workshops at the 2023 NERRS Annual Meeting will be largely intertwined, so materials for both will be found in this GitHub Repository. Preparation for both workshops is the same. I have been assured coffee will be provided, but I also understand if you'd rather bring some, just in case.  

# Pre-workshop prep

You're bringing a laptop, right? You don't truly *have to*, but you'll probably get bored if you don't. Here's what you need to have on it. **Please don't wait until the last minute, in case you need to get someone with administrative privileges to install these programs!**

1.  **R**. At least version 4.1. The version as of this writing is 4.3.1. Download it for your operating system from CRAN: <https://cran.r-project.org/>\
2.  **RTools** - if your computer runs on Windows (which is most of us). This helps install packages. Download here: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>\
3.  **RStudio**, free desktop version, at least version 2022.12.0, but you really want the most recent version. **Install this only after installing R from CRAN.** Installing R first is so important there's even a link to CRAN on the RStudio download page. <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>  


# 8 - 10 am. Intro to R and RStudio: finding your way around and setting yourself up for success.  

If you’ve never used R before, or don’t use it much but need it for some things (e.g., SWMP Status Reports, SETr), this workshop is for you! We will walk through the settings in RStudio to make the interface one you can understand and use, even if you never intend to write a single line of code yourself. We will also talk about some of the foundational ideas of R: the very basics of packages and functions, the different ways people write code and view outputs, and how to think about an overall workflow. If you’ve asked questions like “Where do I even start?” or “What do all these words mean?” or “Why do I need that package, and what even is a package, anyway?” this workshop is your entry point.

# 10:30 am - 12:30 pm.  How to solve problems in R.  

Face it, you can take all the intro-to-R workshops you want, and you will still run into problems. This is part of being a programmer. One of the most important R skills is not related to code itself but rather how to find answers to your questions. There are many resources—an overwhelming amount of information—and this workshop will teach you how to sift through all the noise and figure out how to solve your problem. It is hard at first but gets easier with time, and this problem-solving is the real key to mastering a programming language. Don't be afraid of running into problems—learn how to solve them.
