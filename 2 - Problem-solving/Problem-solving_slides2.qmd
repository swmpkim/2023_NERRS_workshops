# Intro and what we will tackle today

## It's universal

## Problems in R

Most of *my* problems arise from one of the following:

-   R is looking in the wrong place for a file\
-   Something is spelled wrong\
-   "Misspellings" include forgetting what I named a variable, and trying to call it as something else\
-   I'm trying to run a function with the wrong type of input

## Major types of problem in R

1.  Something isn't working.
    a.  Spelling, punctuation, file path problem, function input problem
    b.  More complicated errors\
2.  You don't even know what to do.
    a.  Is there a function to run \[this analysis\]?\
    b.  How do I run an NMDS?\
3.  You figure out an answer for 2, but then it doesn't work and you're back at 1.

::: notes
Punctuation - mainly parentheses or brackets. RStudio helps a lot with this - tells you when something is wrong (in the left margin), and enabling "rainbow parentheses" in the global options is MAGICAL.

Tools menu -- Global Options -- Code (from left pane) -- Display (a tab in main pane) -- Syntax (in the Display tab) -- bottom option: "Use rainbow parentheses"

# How to start troubleshooting

## Get specific about the problem

-   Did you get an error message? Was it just a warning?\
-   Did you not get output at all?\
-   Did you get output, but it doesn't look right?\
-   What caused the error? You may have to scroll up, if you haven't been running code line-by-line.

::: notes
Line-by-line is GREAT for troubleshooting.

The FIRST error will make a bunch of things fail downstream.
